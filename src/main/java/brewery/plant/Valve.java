 * File Name: Valve.java
 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Represents a valve component in the breweryâ€™s manifold system. A valve
 *     controls the opening and closing of fluid paths between connected pipes
 *     and vats. Its state determines whether liquid can pass through a given
 *     section of the system.
 *
 *     Valves are managed by the {@link Manifold}, which toggles them during
 *     batch transfer operations to route flow safely and prevent contamination
 *     between lines.
