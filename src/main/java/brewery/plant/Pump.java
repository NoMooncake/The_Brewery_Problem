 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Represents a pump unit responsible for driving fluid through the
 *     breweryâ€™s piping system. Each pump can be started or stopped, and
 *     maintains an internal running state used to determine whether it is
 *     actively operating during a transfer.
 *
 *     Pumps are managed collectively by the {@link Manifold}, which activates
 *     them when establishing flow between vats as part of a transfer process.
