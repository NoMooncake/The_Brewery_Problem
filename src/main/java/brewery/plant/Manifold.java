 * File Name: Manifold.java
 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Models the plantâ€™s connection hub that coordinates pipes, valves, and
 *     pumps to establish fluid routes between vats. The manifold maintains
 *     internal collections of {@link Pipe}, {@link Valve}, and {@link Pump},
 *     and exposes a high-level API (connect) to assemble an operational path
 *     from a source {@link Vat} to a destination {@link Vat}.
 *
 *     In the full system, this component is typically invoked by transfer
 *     orchestration (e.g., a TransferOrder) after a path is computed by
 *     {@link brewery.services.PathFinder}. It is responsible for selecting
 *     clean/available segments and preparing actuation (open/close valves,
 *     start/stop pumps) required for a safe transfer.
