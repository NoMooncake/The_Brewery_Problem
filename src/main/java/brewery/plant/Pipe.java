 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Represents a pipeline segment within the breweryâ€™s manifold network.
 *     Each Pipe maintains a cleanliness state used to determine whether it
 *     can safely transport liquid between vats. The state can be toggled
 *     through {@code markClean()} and {@code markDirty()} depending on
 *     transfer usage and sanitation processes.
 *
 *     Pipes are coordinated by the {@link Manifold} class, which selects
 *     clean and available connections when establishing fluid routes for
 *     batch transfers.
