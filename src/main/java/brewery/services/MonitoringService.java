 * File Name: MonitoringService.java
 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Provides monitoring and data recording functionality for active
 *     {@link brewery.production.Batch} instances. The service collects sensor
 *     readings such as temperature and specific gravity from instruments like
 *     {@link Thermometer} and {@link Hydrometer}, and stores them as
 *     {@link brewery.production.Reading} objects within each batch.
 *
 *     This component acts as an intermediary between physical sensors and the
 *     Brewery System, supporting process tracking and quality assurance. In a
 *     future implementation, it could generate alerts or trigger adjustments
 *     when readings deviate from recipe targets.
