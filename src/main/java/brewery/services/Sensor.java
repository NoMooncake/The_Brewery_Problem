 * File Name: Sensor.java
 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Abstract base class for all sensor types used within the breweryâ€™s
 *     monitoring subsystem. Each concrete subclass (e.g.,
 *     {@link Thermometer}, {@link Hydrometer}) must implement the
 *     {@link #read()} method to provide measurement data such as temperature
 *     or specific gravity.
 *
 *     This abstraction enables the {@link MonitoringService} to record sensor
 *     readings uniformly without depending on specific hardware details,
 *     promoting modularity and testability.
