 * File Name: TransferOrder.java
 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Encapsulates an instruction to move a {@link Batch} from one {@link Vat}
 *     to another at a scheduled time. A TransferOrder coordinates with
 *     {@link brewery.services.PathFinder} to compute a clean/feasible route,
 *     and with {@link brewery.plant.Manifold} to actuate pipes, valves, and
 *     pumps for the physical transfer. It may consult the
 *     {@link brewery.plant.PlantRegistry} to resolve equipment references.
 *
 *     In a full implementation, execution should update plant sanitation
 *     state (clean/dirty) and the batchâ€™s location/status accordingly.
