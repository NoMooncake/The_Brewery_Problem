 * File Name: BottlingLine.java
 * Project: The Brewery Problem
 * Description:
 *     Represents the bottling subsystem of the brewery, responsible for
 *     packaging a completed {@link Batch} into its final bottled form.
 *     This class provides high-level methods to initiate and complete the
 *     bottling process, which typically marks the end of the production
 *     lifecycle for a batch.
 *
 *     In a full implementation, this component would coordinate with
 *     {@link brewery.plant.BottlingVat} and update the batchâ€™s
 *     {@link BatchStatus} accordingly.
